            <p> Hi, I’m Ryan Posey — a web developer who believes that any great design lives at the intersection of
                clarity, usability, and purpose. I build responsive, accessible websites with clean structure and
                intuitive layouts, and I love solving technical challenges that make digital experiences smoother and
                more engaging. I’ve had the honor of competing at the national <span class="fst-italic">SkillsUSA</span>
                conference in Web Design and Development, where I placed among the top three — an experience that
                sharpened my skills and affirmed my commitment to high-quality, thoughtful work. This <span
                    class="fst-italic">“Code-folio”</span> is where I showcase projects that reflect my passion for web
                design and development, each one crafted with intention and a focus on meaningful user experience. </p>
